# Indonesian Grapheme-to-Phoneme

This module is designed to convert Indonesian grapheme (spelling) to phonemes (pronunciation). Luckiliy, most of Indonesian word pronounciation can be inferred from its spelling. However there are some exceptions. For example, there are two(?) different way to pronounce "e": "è" as in "lelet" and "ê" as in "enam".
